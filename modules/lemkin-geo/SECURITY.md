## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Lemkin AI team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send email to security@lemkin.org. Include detailed information about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.

## Security Considerations for Geospatial Analysis

### Sensitive Location Data

Geospatial analysis involves processing location information that may include:

- **Precise Coordinates**: GPS coordinates that can reveal exact locations
- **Movement Patterns**: Travel routes and behavioral patterns
- **Safe Houses**: Locations that must remain confidential for safety
- **Witness Locations**: Addresses and coordinates of witnesses and victims
- **Investigation Sites**: Locations under investigation that could compromise operations

### Security Best Practices

When using lemkin-geo, please:

1. **Location Privacy**:
   - Encrypt coordinate data both at rest and in transit
   - Use coordinate obfuscation for non-critical analysis
   - Implement access controls for sensitive location data
   - Audit all location data access and processing

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Store geospatial databases in encrypted storage systems
   - Use secure protocols for satellite imagery and mapping services
   - Implement proper authentication for mapping APIs
   - Monitor and log all geospatial data access

3. **Operational Security**:
   - Use VPNs when accessing satellite imagery services
   - Avoid patterns in geospatial queries that could reveal investigations
   - Implement geographic data segregation by case
   - Use anonymous credentials for mapping service access where possible

4. **Witness Protection**:
   - Never store exact coordinates of witness locations in plain text
   - Use geographic zones rather than precise coordinates when possible
   - Implement automatic coordinate fuzzing for sensitive locations
   - Maintain separate access controls for witness location data

5. **Evidence Integrity**:
   - Maintain immutable records of original coordinates
   - Use cryptographic hashing for geospatial evidence integrity
   - Document all coordinate transformations and processing steps
   - Implement audit trails for geospatial analysis workflows

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Coordinate Precision**: High-precision coordinates may reveal sensitive locations

2. **Satellite Imagery**: Accessing satellite imagery may leave digital footprints

3. **Mapping Services**: Third-party mapping APIs may log requests and locations

4. **Metadata Exposure**: Geospatial files may contain sensitive metadata

5. **Cross-Reference Attacks**: Multiple location data points may enable identification

## Geospatial-Specific Security Issues

We are particularly concerned about vulnerabilities in these areas:

### High Priority
- Exposure of sensitive coordinates or location data
- Unauthorized access to satellite imagery or mapping services
- Location data that could endanger witnesses or victims
- Geospatial analysis that could reveal investigation methods
- Mapping service API key exposure or abuse

### Medium Priority
- Insufficient encryption of coordinate databases
- Inadequate access controls for location-sensitive analysis
- Geospatial metadata leakage in exported files
- Cross-contamination between geographic investigations
- Performance issues with large geospatial datasets

### Geospatial-Specific Vulnerabilities
- Coordinate system injection attacks
- Satellite imagery service abuse or policy violations
- Geographic data that could compromise operational security
- Location pattern analysis that reveals sensitive information
- Insufficient anonymization of geographic evidence

## Location Data Protection

### Privacy-Preserving Techniques

```python
# Example: Coordinate obfuscation for non-critical analysis
def obfuscate_coordinates(lat: float, lon: float, radius: float = 100.0) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """Add random noise to coordinates within specified radius."""
    # Implementation that adds controlled noise to coordinates
    pass

# Example: Geographic zone-based analysis
def analyze_by_zone(coordinates: List[Coordinate], zone_size: float = 1000.0) -> ZoneAnalysis:
    """Analyze events by geographic zones rather than exact coordinates."""
    # Implementation that groups coordinates into zones
    pass
```

### Safe Satellite Imagery Access

- Use anonymous API credentials where legally permitted
- Implement request throttling to avoid suspicious patterns
- Cache imagery locally to minimize repeated requests
- Document legitimate use for legal compliance

## Legal and Operational Considerations

### Human Rights Context

Geospatial analysis in human rights investigations requires:

- **Witness Safety**: Protecting the locations of witnesses and victims
- **Operational Security**: Preventing compromise of investigation activities
- **Evidence Integrity**: Maintaining chain of custody for location evidence
- **Legal Admissibility**: Ensuring geospatial evidence meets court standards

### International Compliance

- Follow international privacy laws regarding location data
- Respect sovereignty and territorial restrictions
- Comply with satellite imagery licensing terms
- Adhere to mapping service terms of use
