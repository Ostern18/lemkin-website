# Lemkin Frameworks

A comprehensive Python library for analyzing evidence against international legal frameworks including the Rome Statute, Geneva Conventions, and human rights instruments.

## Overview

The Lemkin Frameworks library provides sophisticated tools for mapping evidence to legal framework elements, conducting confidence-based assessments, and generating comprehensive legal analyses across multiple international law domains.

### Named After Raphael Lemkin

This library is named in honor of Raphael Lemkin (1900-1959), the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the term "genocide" and was instrumental in the development of international criminal law. His pioneering work laid the foundation for the legal frameworks this library analyzes.

## Features

- **Multi-Framework Analysis**: Support for Rome Statute (ICC), Geneva Conventions, ICCPR, ECHR, ACHR, ACHPR, and UDHR
- **Advanced Evidence Processing**: Sophisticated algorithms for evidence-to-element mapping
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed confidence breakdowns with multiple scoring factors
- **Gap Analysis**: Identification of evidence gaps and investigation recommendations  
- **Cross-Framework Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis across multiple legal frameworks
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Complete command-line interface with multiple analysis modes
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy addition of new legal frameworks

## Installation

```bash
pip install lemkin-frameworks
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lemkin-frameworks.git

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from lemkin_frameworks import LegalFrameworkMapper, Evidence, LegalFramework, EvidenceType
from datetime import datetime

# Create evidence
evidence = [
    Evidence(
        title="Witness Testimony - Mass Killing",
        content="Witness observed systematic killing of civilians belonging to specific ethnic group...",
        evidence_type=EvidenceType.TESTIMONY,
        source="Investigation Report #1",
        reliability_score=0.85,
        incident_date=datetime(2023, 6, 15)
    )
]

# Initialize mapper
mapper = LegalFrameworkMapper()

# Analyze against Rome Statute
analysis = mapper.map_to_legal_framework(evidence, LegalFramework.ROME_STATUTE)

print(f"Overall Confidence: {analysis.overall_confidence:.1%}")

## Legal Frameworks Supported

### 1. Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court

Analyzes evidence against ICC crimes:
- **Genocide (Article 6)**: All five acts of genocide with detailed element analysis
- **Crimes Against Humanity (Article 7)**: Murder, extermination, deportation, torture, rape, persecution, enforced disappearance, apartheid, and other inhumane acts
- **War Crimes (Article 8)**: Grave breaches and serious violations in international and non-international armed conflicts
- **Jurisdictional Elements**: Temporal, territorial, personal, and complementarity assessments

```python
from lemkin_frameworks import RomeStatuteAnalyzer

analyzer = RomeStatuteAnalyzer()
rome_analysis = analyzer.analyze(evidence)

# Access specific crime findings
print("Genocide findings:", len(rome_analysis.genocide_findings))
print("Crimes against humanity:", len(rome_analysis.crimes_against_humanity_findings))
print("War crimes:", len(rome_analysis.war_crimes_findings))
```

### 2. Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols

International Humanitarian Law analysis:
- **Geneva Convention I**: Protection of wounded and sick in armed forces
- **Geneva Convention II**: Protection of wounded, sick, and shipwrecked at sea  
- **Geneva Convention III**: Treatment of prisoners of war
- **Geneva Convention IV**: Protection of civilian persons in time of war
- **Additional Protocol I**: Protection of victims of international armed conflicts
- **Additional Protocol II**: Protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts

```python
from lemkin_frameworks import GenevaAnalyzer

analyzer = GenevaAnalyzer()
geneva_analysis = analyzer.analyze(evidence)

# Access IHL-specific analysis
print("Grave breaches:", len(geneva_analysis.grave_breaches_found))
print("Protected persons violations:", len(geneva_analysis.protected_persons_analysis))
```

### 3. Human Rights Frameworks

Comprehensive human rights analysis across multiple instruments:

#### Universal Instruments
- **UDHR**: Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- **ICCPR**: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

#### Regional Instruments  
- **ECHR**: European Convention on Human Rights
- **ACHR**: American Convention on Human Rights
- **ACHPR**: African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights

```python
from lemkin_frameworks import HumanRightsAnalyzer

# Analyze against ICCPR
analyzer = HumanRightsAnalyzer(LegalFramework.ICCPR)
hr_analysis = analyzer.analyze(evidence)

# Access human rights specific analysis
print("State responsibility:", hr_analysis.state_responsibility_assessment)
print("Individual remedies:", hr_analysis.individual_remedies)
```

## Evidence Types and Processing

The library supports multiple evidence types with specialized processing:

### Evidence Types
- **Documents**: Official documents, reports, orders, policies
- **Testimony**: Witness statements, victim accounts, expert testimony
- **Physical Evidence**: Forensic evidence, weapons, physical objects
- **Digital Evidence**: Electronic documents, communications, digital media
- **Photos**: Visual evidence, documentation of damage/harm
- **Video**: Moving visual evidence, documentation of events
- **Audio**: Recorded statements, communications, ambient sound
- **Geospatial**: Location data, maps, satellite imagery
- **Forensic**: Scientific analysis results, DNA evidence
- **Expert Reports**: Professional analysis, technical assessments

### Evidence Analysis Features

```python
# Evidence with metadata
evidence = Evidence(
    title="Medical Report - Torture Evidence",
    content="Medical examination reveals injuries consistent with torture...",
    evidence_type=EvidenceType.EXPERT_REPORT,
    source="Medical Expert Dr. Smith",
    location="Detention Center A",
    tags=["torture", "medical", "expert_analysis"],
    metadata={"expert_credentials": "Forensic medical specialist"},
    reliability_score=0.9
)

# Advanced confidence scoring
from lemkin_frameworks import ElementAnalyzer

analyzer = ElementAnalyzer()
satisfaction = analyzer.analyze_element_satisfaction(evidence_list, legal_element)

# Access detailed scoring breakdown
print("Keyword match score:", satisfaction.score_breakdown["keyword_match"])
print("Semantic similarity:", satisfaction.score_breakdown["semantic_similarity"])
print("Evidence strength:", satisfaction.score_breakdown["evidence_strength"])
```

## Analysis Methodology

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The library uses a sophisticated multi-factor confidence scoring algorithm:

1. **Keyword Matching (25%)**: Exact and fuzzy matching of legal keywords
2. **Semantic Similarity (20%)**: TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
3. **Evidence Strength (20%)**: Relevance weighted by reliability
4. **Evidence Quantity (15%)**: Logarithmic scaling for optimal evidence count
5. **Evidence Diversity (10%)**: Variety of evidence types and sources
6. **Temporal Relevance (5%)**: Recency and temporal context
7. **Reliability Factor (10%)**: Source credibility and evidence quality
8. **Completeness (10%)**: Coverage of legal element requirements

### Element Satisfaction Levels

- **Satisfied** (â‰¥80% confidence): Strong evidence supporting the element
- **Partially Satisfied** (50-79% confidence): Moderate evidence with some gaps
- **Insufficient Evidence** (20-49% confidence): Some relevant evidence but significant gaps
- **Not Satisfied** (<20% confidence): Little or no relevant evidence

### Gap Analysis

The system identifies specific evidence needs:

```python
# Access gap analysis
gaps = analysis.gap_analysis

print("Missing elements:", gaps.missing_elements)
print("Weak elements:", gaps.weak_elements)
print("Evidence needs:", gaps.evidence_needs)
print("Recommendations:", gaps.recommendations)
print("Priority score:", gaps.priority_score)
```

## Configuration and Customization

from lemkin_frameworks import LegalFrameworkMapper, Evidence

def analyze_case_documents(document_paths, frameworks):
    evidence_list = []
    
    for doc_path in document_paths:
        # Extract content using your preferred method
        content = extract_document_content(doc_path)
        
        evidence = Evidence(

from lemkin_frameworks.element_analyzer import ElementAnalyzer

class CustomFrameworkAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.element_analyzer = ElementAnalyzer()
        self.legal_elements = self._load_framework_elements()
    
    def _load_framework_elements(self):
        """Load elements for your custom framework"""
        elements = {}
        
        elements["custom_element_1"] = LegalElement(
            id="custom_element_1",
            framework=LegalFramework.CUSTOM,  # Add to enum
            article="Article 1",
            title="Custom Legal Element",
            description="Description of the legal requirement",
            requirements=[
                "First requirement",
                "Second requirement"
            ],
            keywords=["keyword1", "keyword2"],

    def analyze(self, evidence):
        """Implement analysis logic"""
        # Follow the pattern from existing analyzers
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

- **Evidence Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize evidence text before analysis
- **Batch Analysis**: Process multiple evidence items together for efficiency
- **Configuration Tuning**: Adjust weights and thresholds based on use case
- **Caching**: Enable caching for repeated analyses of similar evidence

```python
# Performance optimization example
config = FrameworkConfig(
    max_elements_analyzed=50,          # Limit elements for faster processing
    enable_advanced_analytics=False,   # Disable ML for speed
    generate_visualizations=False      # Skip visualization generation
)

# Use batch processing for large evidence sets
def process_large_evidence_set(evidence_items, batch_size=100):
    results = []
    for i in range(0, len(evidence_items), batch_size):
        batch = evidence_items[i:i+batch_size]
        result = mapper.analyze_evidence_batch(batch)
        results.extend(result)
    return results
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling

The library is designed with security in mind:

- **No External API Calls**: All processing is done locally
- **Evidence Anonymization**: Support for anonymizing sensitive evidence
- **Audit Logging**: Configurable logging for compliance requirements
- **Secure Configuration**: Secure handling of configuration parameters

```python
# Anonymize sensitive evidence
from lemkin_frameworks.utils import anonymize_evidence

anonymized_evidence = anonymize_evidence(
    evidence,
    anonymize_names=True,
    anonymize_locations=True,
    preserve_legal_terms=True
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Confidence Scores**
   - Check evidence quality and relevance
   - Verify legal element keywords are present
   - Consider adjusting confidence threshold

2. **Missing Evidence Types**
   - Ensure evidence type is correctly specified
   - Check evidence content is properly formatted
   - Verify reliability scores are reasonable

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce max_elements_analyzed in configuration
   - Disable advanced analytics for faster processing
   - Use batch processing for large datasets

### Debug Mode

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Enable detailed logging
from loguru import logger
logger.add("debug.log", level="DEBUG")

# Analyze with debug information
analysis = mapper.map_to_legal_framework(evidence, framework)
```
