Lemkin AI democratizes legal investigation technology for international human rights investigators, prosecutors, civil rights attorneys, and public defenders. Our open-source platform transforms complex legal investigation from manual document review into intelligent, AI-augmented analysis while maintaining the highest standards of evidence integrity and legal ethics.

## 🎯 Mission

- **Justice Access**: Provide every public interest lawyer with analytical power equivalent to a 20-person research unit
- **Evidence Integrity**: Maintain immutable evidence storage with complete chain of custody
- **Human Authority**: AI suggests, humans decide - especially for legal conclusions
- **Global Impact**: Support both domestic civil rights and international human rights work

lemkin-audio transcribe interview.wav --language en-US --output transcription.json

# 3. Verify image authenticity
lemkin-images detect-manipulation photo_evidence.jpg --output analysis.json

# 4. Collect supporting OSINT
lemkin-osint collect-social-media "search terms" --platforms twitter,facebook

# 5. Generate geospatial analysis
lemkin-geo correlate-events events.json --radius 1000 --output correlation.json
```
