# Lemkin AI Ecosystem Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Lemkin AI ecosystem processes the most sensitive information in legal investigations - evidence that can determine the outcome of human rights cases, criminal prosecutions, and civil rights actions. Security is not just a technical requirement, it's a fundamental responsibility to the investigators, witnesses, and victims who depend on this technology.

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **System Hardening**:
   ```bash
   # Use dedicated investigation systems
   # Keep systems updated and patched
   # Use disk encryption (FileVault, BitLocker)
   # Enable system firewall
   ```

2. **Network Security**:
   ```bash
   # Use VPN for all investigation work
   # Avoid public WiFi for sensitive operations
   # Use HTTPS/TLS for all data transfers
   # Implement network monitoring
   ```

3. **Access Control**:
   ```bash
   # Use strong, unique passwords
   # Enable multi-factor authentication
   # Implement role-based access control
   # Regular access reviews and deprovisioning
   ```

4. **Evidence Handling**:
   ```bash
   # Always work with forensic copies
   # Verify evidence integrity before processing
   # Maintain complete chain of custody
   # Use secure storage with access logging
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**:
   ```python
   # Never hardcode secrets
   API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
   if not API_KEY:
       raise SecurityError("API key required")

   # Always validate inputs
   def process_file(file_path: Path) -> Result:
       validate_file_path(file_path)
       validate_file_type(file_path)
       validate_file_size(file_path)
       scan_for_malware(file_path)
       # ... continue processing

   # Use secure temporary files
   with secure_temp_file() as temp:
       # ... process data
       pass  # File automatically securely deleted
   ```

2. **Privacy Protection**:
   ```python
   # Automatic PII detection
   from lemkin_redaction import PIIDetector

   detector = PIIDetector()
   pii_results = detector.detect_pii(content)
   if pii_results:
       content = detector.redact_pii(content, pii_results)
       log_pii_detection(pii_results)  # For audit trail
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   ```python
   # Never expose sensitive information in errors
   try:
       result = process_sensitive_data(data)
   except ProcessingError as e:
       # Log full error details securely
       security_logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}", extra={
           "user_id": user_id,
           "operation": "data_processing",
           "timestamp": datetime.utcnow()
       })

       # Return sanitized error to user
       raise UserError("Processing failed. Support has been notified.")
   ```
