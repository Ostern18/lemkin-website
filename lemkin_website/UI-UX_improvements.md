Article Preview Cards
Hover and Click States: Each card should be entirely clickable (not just the title text) to improve usability. On hover (or focus via keyboard), apply a subtle elevation or highlight: for example, a slight drop-shadow and a light background tint (in light mode) or a slightly brighter outline (in dark mode). This gives a tactile feel to the UI, indicating interactivity, much like the polished hover states in OpenAI’s interfaces. The transition should be smooth to maintain a refined feel.

Visual Design & Typography

Typography: Adopt a clean sans-serif font for both headings and body text across the site. A font in the vein of OpenAI’s UI (which uses simple, modern sans-serifs) will convey a contemporary and approachable tone. For example, fonts like Inter, Source Sans Pro, or Roboto would work well – they are legible, neutral, and render consistently across devices. Use a consistent font family site-wide to maintain cohesion.

Titles/Headings: The page title (“Articles”) should be large (e.g. ~2.25rem or 36px, bold) and article titles in cards slightly smaller (as noted, ~1.5–1.75rem). Section headings (if any) should use a clear size step-down (perhaps 1.25rem, bold). This typographic hierarchy ensures users can instantly distinguish titles from subtitles and body text.

Body and Metadata: Use ~1rem (16px) for regular text like excerpts, with a comfortable line-height (1.5 to 1.6) for readability. Meta text can be slightly smaller (~0.875rem) but ensure it meets accessibility contrast standards. The overall text color scheme should be high contrast on both light and dark backgrounds (e.g. nearly black (#111) on white, and light gray (#ddd) on dark) to maintain readability under all conditions

 (Palantir’s design guidelines emphasize sufficient contrast for accessibility).

Color Palette: Stick to a neutral and professional palette. The interface background should be white or a very light gray in light mode, and a deep charcoal or black in dark mode – providing a clean canvas for content. Accent colors (for links, category badges, or buttons) can take inspiration from the Lemkin AI branding or common enterprise tones: for instance, a deep blue or teal for primary actions, and subtle grays for secondary elements. Avoid overly bright or saturated colors that might feel playful; instead use restrained hues that suggest trust and seriousness (echoing an “institutional-grade” feel). For example, the current design’s use of blue for category badges is effective; we can extend this approach with a defined set of accent colors for different categories or interactive elements (blue for primary, gray for neutral, etc.), all chosen to look good in both light and dark themes.

Styling & Icons: Leverage the existing Tailwind CSS utility classes and design tokens (as Lemkin already does) to ensure consistency. Buttons and icons (like the share icon, arrows, etc.) should use a thin line style (the Lucide icon set being used is appropriate) to match the minimalist aesthetic. Incorporate Palantir’s Blueprint principles of consistency: all cards share the same structure, all icons align in style, and spacing is uniform, which contributes to a predictable user experience

.

Dark Mode: The redesign will fully support dark mode with equal attention to detail. In dark mode, card backgrounds would be a dark gray (e.g. #1e1e1e) with lighter gray text. The category badge colors should adjust (e.g. the blue badge becomes a desaturated navy tone with light text in dark mode, as currently implemented). Ensure that in dark mode, the same hierarchy and contrast principles hold – the background is sufficiently dark and text sufficiently light. All hover states and accents should be re-tuned for dark mode (for example, a card might lighten slightly on hover rather than darken). The goal is a seamless experience when toggling themes, with no loss of clarity or aesthetic quality.

Efficiency & Accessibility

Quick Scanning: The layout should enable a user to quickly scroll and identify relevant articles. This means using whitespace strategically – adequate padding between cards and sections to avoid clutter, but not so much empty space that it wastes screen real estate. Group related elements (title with excerpt, author with date) closer together, and separate distinct groups (different articles) with larger gaps. This visual grouping helps the eye parse information faster.

By applying these design choices, the Articles listing page will appear clean, informative, and credible at first glance. Users will immediately recognize a modern, high-quality interface that feels akin to an OpenAI or Palantir product – minimal yet data-rich. The information hierarchy (titles → excerpts → metadata) and supportive tools (search, filters) will let them locate content with confidence and speed, fulfilling the platform’s promise as a professional-grade tool.

Individual Article Page Redesign
Layout & Information Hierarchy

The article detail view should balance rich information with an easy-to-read layout, so that busy professionals can digest insights efficiently. Key structural elements, in order of appearance:

Back Navigation: At the very top, provide a clear way to return to the Articles list. A simple textual back link with an icon (e.g. ← Back to Articles) in the upper left of the content area will do. This should be consistent with the platform’s navigation style (the current design’s small arrow-left icon and “Back to Articles” button is a good approach). It ensures users can quickly retreat to the list and is especially important in a mission context where they might need to reference multiple briefs in succession. Keep this back link subtle (small font, perhaps gray-colored text) so it doesn’t dominate the page, but visible enough on both light and dark backgrounds (hover state can underline or brighten it for clarity).

Article Title: The title of the article should be the focal point of the page. Use a large, bold font (e.g. 2.5–3rem on desktop, scaling down slightly on mobile) for the title, similar to a report or whitepaper title. For example, if the listing card showed “Large Language Models for Legal Document Analysis,” the detail page will show that as a headline, much larger and centered or left-aligned for a professional look. The title can span multiple lines if lengthy, but should have additional line-height if so, to maintain readability. This prominent title treatment echoes OpenAI’s clean, bold headings and signals to the user that they are now in the detailed view of that selected brief.

Subtitle/Excerpt: Directly beneath the title, include the brief excerpt or a short abstract of the article (if provided). In the current content, this was the excerpt field (e.g. “Balancing transformative potential with critical risks…”). Style this as an introductory paragraph: perhaps italicized or in a slightly lighter weight, and in a font size a bit larger than body text (e.g. 1.125rem or 18px). This text serves as an overview of the article’s key theme, so it should stand out just enough to invite the user to continue reading. It can be formatted in a neutral gray tone to differentiate it from the main body (to look like a synopsis), but ensure it’s still legible (e.g. medium gray on light background).

Article Meta (Author, Date, etc.): Below the subtitle (or alongside it, depending on layout width), present the article’s metadata clearly. A common approach is a byline line: e.g. “By Oliver Stern — July 15, 2025 — 16 min read”. This can be in the same style as on the listing (small, muted text), but here we might put it just above the content or at the very top of the content area so the reader sees it before diving into the text. Another design pattern is to place author and date right under the title in a slightly smaller font, perhaps even on the same line if space permits. We will maintain the same iconography for consistency (user icon, calendar icon, clock icon as needed). The goal is to give credit and context (date of publication) without drawing too much attention – these are secondary details. Using a divider (• or a vertical bar) between items can help separate them cleanly.

Category & Tags: To reinforce content classification and aid navigation, show the category badge and any tags for the article near the top as well. For instance, the category badge (e.g. “AI & Technology”) can sit above or before the title (as a small label), or it can be aligned to the right side of the header area. Tags (keywords like “Legal Tech” or “Evidence Processing”) can be displayed as a series of smaller pill-shaped buttons either right below the meta info or at the very bottom of the header section. In the current design, tags are shown as hashtags below the meta. We will refine their appearance: use the same pill style as category but in a neutral color (gray background, for example) with a “#TagName” label. Ensure there is modest spacing (a bit of margin-top) before the tags section so it’s clearly separated from the author/date line. These tags act as quick identifiers of the article’s topics, which is useful for an expert user scanning the page for relevance. (In a future enhancement, tags could even be clickable filters to find related content, but for now they serve as visual cues.)

All the above header elements (title, subtitle, meta, category, tags) should be grouped in a visually cohesive way, likely contained within a dedicated header section with extra bottom padding and perhaps a subtle bottom border or divider line. For example, a light gray horizontal rule or just extra spacing can separate the article header from the content that follows, similar to an “article hero” section in many modern blogs. This structure establishes a credible report-like feel, much like how professional reports or Palantir’s documentation pages introduce content with clear metadata and titles (imparting that sense of rigorous structure that users trust).

Content Body Formatting (Copy Layout & Typography)

The main content of the article should be presented in a reader-friendly format that feels authoritative and easy to navigate. We will apply a consistent typographic style and spacing to all articles, leveraging a “content typography” design (Tailwind’s Prose classes or custom styles) to automatically style elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists within the article. Key guidelines:

Body Font & Size: Use the same sans-serif typeface for the article text as the rest of the UI for consistency. A font size of 16px (1rem) for body text is recommended for comfortable long-form reading on desktop, with line-height around 1.6 (to avoid fatigue). Consider slightly larger base text (17–18px) on very large screens for optimal readability at distance. Because these articles may be dense (the example content covers technical and legal analysis), readability is paramount. We may also consider using a serif font for body text to give a more book-like reading experience (serifs can guide the eye in long passages), but only if it integrates well with the overall design. If mixing fonts, do so sparingly (e.g. use serif just for the main article text and sans-serif for UI chrome like headings and captions) to maintain a clean look.

Headings within Content: Ensure a clear hierarchy for headings inside the article. Typically, the article’s title is an H1 (but since we display title separately in the header, the content likely starts at H2). For section headings (H2) – e.g. “## Key Points” or “## Conclusion” in the content – style them distinctively: perhaps 1.5rem (24px), semi-bold, with a top margin of 1.5em (to separate from previous content) and bottom margin of 0.5em. They should use the same text color as the main text but at full opacity (e.g. solid black/white depending on theme) to stand out. For subsection headings (H3), use ~1.25rem (20px), bold or semi-bold, with slightly smaller margins. All headings in content can use the same font as body but a heavier weight, or even a complementary font if desired for contrast (though likely unnecessary). The styling should be consistent with an enterprise documentation style – no fancy decorative fonts, just clean and slightly larger text to denote importance. In code terms, our renderer already transforms # to an H1 style (which we might actually avoid using since the title is separate) and ## to H2, etc., with appropriate classes (as seen in the current implementation). We will refine those classes to match these size/spacing guidelines for a polished look.

Paragraphs: Body paragraphs should have moderate spacing between them (e.g. a margin-bottom of 1em or 1.25em). Text should be left-aligned (for left-to-right languages) and not justified – left alignment is easier to read and feels less formalistic, aligning with OpenAI’s approachable tone. Ensure no single line is too long; our max content width (currently about max-w-4xl, ~64rem or ~1024px) should be maintained to keep line length around 80–100 characters max. This prevents the text from becoming hard to track, a practice both OpenAI and Palantir would follow for readability.

Emphasis and Inline Elements: Any emphasis (italic, bold) or inline code/commands in the article text should be styled to be noticeable yet consistent with the professional tone. Bold text can be used to highlight key terms or conclusions – ensure it’s actually a slightly darker or heavier font-weight so it stands out. Italic text (if used for definitions or emphasis) should be a true italic from the font family. The color for these can remain the same as body text (maybe just the default black/white) to avoid any garish highlights, as we want emphasis to be visual (weight/style) not color-driven. If any hyperlinks appear in the article text, use a subtle underline or a distinct color that fits the palette (perhaps a blue that’s not too bright) and ensure a clear hover state (underline or color change) so users know they can click. Given this is an internal platform, links might be rare or point to docs, but styling them consistently is important (and they should be tested to meet contrast requirements on dark backgrounds as well).

Lists and Key Points: Many articles have bullet point lists (for example, a “Key Points” section). These lists should be indented slightly and use a clear bullet style (a simple round bullet or a en dash). We will add a bit of spacing (perhaps 0.5em) before and after lists to separate them from surrounding paragraphs. The list items themselves can be spaced tightly (0.25em between items) to show they are a group. If there is a section like “## Key Points” which is essentially a summary, we can give it special visual treatment to draw the eye. For instance, Key Points callout: we might add a subtle background shading to that specific list or an left border highlight (e.g. a light blue translucent box behind the bullet list, or a colored line to the left). This is similar to how some enterprise UIs highlight important info, and it caters to users who may skim for key takeaways. However, this should be done with restraint – perhaps using the same accent color as the category badge for consistency. The text of key points can remain standard size but could be bolded or otherwise emphasized since they represent critical insights. This way, even a user who doesn’t read the full article can glean the main ideas quickly – aligning with the need for rapid understanding in high-consequence scenarios.

Blockquotes or Citations: If any article text includes quotes or cited text (for example, a witness statement or an excerpt from law), style these as blockquotes: indented on the left, with maybe a subtle left border line, and italic font. We can also slightly decrease the font size of blockquotes to differentiate them, and use a lighter color (dark gray) to indicate it’s a quote. This treatment will make quoted material stand out for credibility (a common pattern in reports and legal documents). Ensure blockquote text is still readable (don’t make it too small or too light).

Images or Media: (If the articles include any images, diagrams, or figures in the future) Center them and give them appropriate max-width (100% of content width) and margin. Provide a caption style below images in a smaller italic text. The redesign should anticipate this, even if current articles are text-only, since visual evidence could be part of legal analysis articles. We will ensure that images have a subtle border or shadow to distinguish them from text, fitting into the overall design without looking like foreign elements. In dark mode, image backgrounds (if any) should also be handled (e.g. if an image has a white background, consider styling the container to avoid a glaring white box in dark theme).

Overall, the article content should have an academic yet modern feel – much like a well-formatted whitepaper or an in-depth blog post from a research lab. By standardizing on a strong typographic style, we make sure even complex analytical writing is as comfortable to read as possible, reducing cognitive load on our users
ux.abhidesigns.com
. The users (lawyers, analysts) can focus on the substance, confident that headings, lists, and highlights will guide them through the narrative logically.

Related Articles: After the main article content (and perhaps a horizontal rule or ample spacing), present a Related Articles section. Title this section clearly (e.g. “Related Articles” or “Further Reading”) with a subheading style consistent with other section headings (2xl size, bold). Under this, display a few article cards similar to those on the listing page, but smaller. The current design filters by shared tags and shows up to 4 related briefs – this is a good approach. We will style these related article cards in a two-column grid (on desktop) or single column (on mobile), akin to the main listing but probably a bit more compact. Use the same card component style (title, short excerpt, author, read time), ensuring consistency. Perhaps omit the category badge here to save space, unless the category is highly relevant – the focus is on titles. Each related card should have a hover effect just like on the main listing, indicating they are clickable. By maintaining uniform card design, we reinforce the cohesive feel of the platform (users should subconsciously recognize that these behave just like the articles on the main page). This section encourages deeper engagement with the platform’s content, but it’s placed in a way that doesn’t interfere with the main article (only after finishing reading).

Consistency & Cohesion: All these supporting elements (footer, share button, related cards) use the same design language as the rest of the site. Buttons use the same styling across the application. Cards in related section match cards on the listing page. Typography in the footer uses the same base font. By doing so, the article page feels like an integral part of the Lemkin AI system, not a separate blog – which is important for establishing trust. Palantir’s design philosophy of a unified system experience is relevant here
blog.palantir.com
: the user should feel that the article tool is as professional and reliable as the rest of the platform (because it is).

Look & Feel: Marrying OpenAI and Palantir Design DNA

To ensure the redesigned Article pages truly meet the benchmark of “premier AI lab” quality, we consciously blend OpenAI’s minimalist, user-friendly feel with Palantir’s robust, mission-critical vibe:

OpenAI-Inspired Elements: The overall interface remains uncluttered and purposeful. We use plenty of whitespace, simple typography, and clear calls-to-action, so nothing extraneous distracts from content. Every element has a reason to exist. For example, much like ChatGPT’s interface focuses you on the conversation, our article page focuses you on the text and insights. Interactive elements (buttons, links) are present but not overpowering — they reveal themselves when needed (via hover states or as the user reaches the footer). This “intellectually rigorous simplicity” is key to making advanced content approachable
ux.abhidesigns.com
. Users should feel the design is elegant and modern, not dull, even though it’s very straightforward. Achieving this often comes down to fine details: smooth animations for interactions, consistent font sizing, and aligning content perfectly in a grid.

Palantir-Inspired Elements: We emphasize trust and structure. The use of clear section divisions, labels like “Last reviewed”, and consistent layout all communicate that this is a serious, professionally built tool. Palantir’s interfaces often give a sense of being in control of a powerful system – we emulate that by providing users with filtering options, quick navigation, and a sense that everything is where it should be. The color scheme is subdued and credible (no flashy gradients or gimmicky visuals), echoing the feel of an enterprise dashboard or an intelligence report. The interface should inspire confidence that the content is authoritative. Additionally, accessibility considerations (high contrast text, keyboard navigation support, responsive design) are first-class – as they would be in any mission-critical software – ensuring the platform can be trusted by all users in all conditions
