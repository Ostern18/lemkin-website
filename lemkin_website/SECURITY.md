## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Lemkin AI team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following channels:

- **Primary**: Email security@lemkin.ai
- **Alternative**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- **Urgent**: Contact our security team directly through our responsible disclosure program

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* **Component affected** (website, specific tool, API, etc.)
* **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
* **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
* **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
* **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
* **Impact assessment**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
* **Potential legal implications** given our focus on legal technology

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what happens:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2 business days.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days, including:
   - Whether we can reproduce the issue
   - Severity assessment using CVSS scoring
   - Preliminary timeline for resolution
   - Legal and ethical implications assessment

3. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate and work on a fix:
   - **Critical/High severity**: Target resolution within 14 days
   - **Medium severity**: Target resolution within 30 days
   - **Low severity**: Target resolution within 60 days

4. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is available:
   - We'll release security patches across all affected components
   - Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
   - CVE numbers will be assigned for significant vulnerabilities
   - Public disclosure will occur 7 days after patch release
   - Legal community will be notified of security-relevant updates

## Security Considerations for Legal Technology

### Sensitive Data Handling

The Lemkin AI ecosystem processes highly sensitive data including:

- **Legal evidence**: Documents, audio, video, images used in legal proceedings
- **Personal information**: Witness testimonies, victim statements, confidential communications
- **Biometric data**: Voice prints, facial recognition data, handwriting analysis
- **Location data**: GPS coordinates, geolocation metadata from evidence
- **Communication metadata**: Network analysis, communication patterns, social graphs

### Security Architecture Principles

Our security approach is built on:

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust, verify everything
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built into every component
4. **Chain of Custody**: Cryptographic integrity throughout evidence lifecycle
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and processing

### Security Best Practices for Users

When using Lemkin AI tools:

#### Data Protection
1. **Encryption at Rest**: Store all evidence in encrypted storage systems
2. **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.3+ for all network communications
3. **Key Management**: Implement proper cryptographic key lifecycle management
4. **Access Controls**: Use principle of least privilege and role-based access

#### Evidence Integrity
1. **Digital Signatures**: Sign all evidence with cryptographic signatures
2. **Hash Verification**: Maintain SHA-256 hashes of all original evidence
3. **Timestamping**: Use trusted timestamping services for evidence dating
4. **Backup Procedures**: Maintain secure, versioned backups of all evidence

#### Network Security
1. **Secure Networks**: Use VPNs or dedicated networks for evidence processing
2. **Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection
3. **Segmentation**: Isolate evidence processing systems from general networks
4. **Firewall Rules**: Implement strict firewall rules and network policies

#### Operational Security
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all system access
2. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
3. **Incident Response**: Maintain documented incident response procedures
4. **Training**: Provide security awareness training for all personnel

### Legal and Compliance Considerations

#### International Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management systems
- **ISO 27037**: Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection for EU subjects
- **Chain of Custody**: Legal standards for evidence handling

#### Jurisdictional Requirements
Users must ensure compliance with:
- Local data protection laws
- Evidence handling regulations
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
- Court admissibility standards
- Legal privilege protections

## Vulnerability Categories

We prioritize vulnerabilities based on potential impact on legal proceedings:

### Critical Priority
- **Evidence Tampering**: Vulnerabilities that could compromise evidence integrity
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to sensitive legal data
- **Authentication Bypass**: Circumventing access controls
- **Remote Code Execution**: Arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
- **Cryptographic Failures**: Weaknesses in encryption or digital signatures

### High Priority
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of user privileges
- **Data Corruption**: Potential corruption of evidence data
- **Audit Trail Manipulation**: Circumventing or corrupting audit logs
- **SQL/NoSQL Injection**: Database injection vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Client-side code injection

### Medium Priority
- **Information Disclosure**: Unintended exposure of non-critical data
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized actions via CSRF
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Insecure default configurations
- **Weak Session Management**: Session handling vulnerabilities
- **Insufficient Logging**: Inadequate security event logging

### Tool-Specific Security Issues
