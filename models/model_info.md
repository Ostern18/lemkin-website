## Website Integration Recommendations

### Display Priorities
1. **Model Names**: Use the professional names provided above
2. **Accuracy Display**: Show as percentages with context (e.g., "95.53% accurate at identifying civilian infrastructure")
3. **Use Cases**: Emphasize humanitarian applications
4. **Performance**: Highlight optimization achievements (e.g., "89% smaller than standard models")

### Technical Requirements
- **TensorFlow.js**: For browser-based inference (if needed)
- **Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving for API endpoints

### API Response Format (Suggested)
```json
{
  "model": "CivInfra-Detection",
  "confidence": 0.9553,
  "detected_class": "hospital",
  "humanitarian_context": "Protected civilian infrastructure",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Deployment Notes
1. All models are production-ready except BuildingDamage-Assessment (needs format conversion)
2. Models optimized for CPU inference (GPU optional)
3. Consider implementing caching for frequent predictions
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
